# A DB for a friend

Just showing a simple way to connect to a DB with ruby

(this app was made in like 15 min so don't mind)

## SETUP:
At your terminal, run:

```
$ gem install activerecord
$ gem install sqlite3
```

## RUNNING:

To create the database tables, run:
```
$ ruby create_database.rb
```

To create the records, run:
```
$ ruby create_records.rb
```

To run your query, run:
```
$ ruby main.rb
```
